A control that sets the topmost style for a form without code !. The control show's a Visual C++ style pin graphic. The object/control poll's the form for the actual state. Includes an object to allow custom implementation. (Without the need for 'subclassing' Spit & Curse). But be warned the topmost state does not allways work under the IDE, (it's a known problem (check the MS KB) but work's ok in the compiled EXE. If you have a problem's mail me.
